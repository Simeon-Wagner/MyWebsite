        "The Traveling salesman problem belongs to the NP hard problems. This means that finding the optimal solution in polynomial time is not possible. In order to achieve good results heuristic methods are used. In this project I tried to find a good solution for the problem using an evolutionary algorithm. The implementation was done in C++ as well as in Java.",
