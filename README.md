# My Website

I started this project without having experience in the frontend development world. I choosed React because I read that the underlying concept is really similar to Flutter (instead of using Widgets you use Components). In fact there are no regrets over my decision. React allows you to enter the Web-Development World in an easy manner.

You can check the source code of my website out and contact me if you see any anti-patterns or bad-practices I made while coding it. I'll be more than glad for constructive criticism.

Have a nice day and enjoy checking out my other projects!
